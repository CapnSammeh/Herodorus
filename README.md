## For Intern Project
Create a SPA (Single Page Application) using an online API that utilises OAuth 2.0. As such a backend/server is not required to be implemented given that the OAuth flow does not require server-to-server authentiation. The content of the application is up to you - with the functionality of the website fullfilling two user stories proposed by you. 

### Example APIs
 * Spotify - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#client-credentials-flow
 * Discord - https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2
 * Twitter - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api

### User Stores

Template: As _, I want _, so that _

e.g As an authorised spotify user, I want to see an analysis of my listening history, so that I can get a deeper understanding of what the type of music I listen to.

For each user story also write a few dot points that ressemble an acceptance criteria.

### Languages 
This blank repo is set up with React, Tailwind, Express, Typscript & Webpack out of the box.

Please Clone & purge git to make your own local copy (forking privileges to come). 

Typescript is optional (but *highly* reccommended).

If your Project does not need a backend server disregard the contents of ```/backend```

Only requirements for the frontend is that React must be used. Any NPM modules that may be of use can and should be utilised.
